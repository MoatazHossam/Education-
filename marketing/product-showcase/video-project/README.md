# Video project

Everything that produces the showcase: the capture of the running application, the script, the renderer,
the score and mix, the subtitles and the documents. It is deterministic: the same inputs give the same frames,
and the documents are generated from the same data as the film.

```
capture/     Playwright: drives the real application on a fresh E2E database and records frames
script/      showcase-20.mjs, showcase-3.mjs (scenes, diacritized narration, English, visuals);
             features.mjs (the capability inventory behind FEATURE_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md)
lib/         timeline (narration timing, scene layout), demo planner (pointer and camera over the
             recordings), audio events, subtitles, WAV reader, static server, review helpers
render/      the player (HTML/CSS/JS in Chromium): scene templates, design system, thumbnail
audio/mix.py the generated score, sound effects and the mix
build.mjs    prepare → audio → video → mux, per cut and resolution
render.mjs   frames → H.264 in parallel 20-second chunks, joined without re-encoding
preview.mjs  single frames for review;  stills.mjs  thumbnail, graphics/ and screenshots/
docs.mjs     the generated documents (storyboard, narration, translation, scene sheet, coverage matrix)
```

## Requirements

- Node 22 and the repository's dependencies (`npm ci` at the repository root: Playwright, sharp, the app).
  Chromium for Playwright 1.56 (`/opt/pw-browsers` in the cloud environment; otherwise
  `npx playwright install chromium`).
- `npm install` here (the fonts: Readex Pro, the application's font, and IBM Plex Mono).
- ffmpeg and ffprobe; Python 3 with numpy and scipy.
- For the score: FluidSynth and the FluidR3 General MIDI soundfont (`apt install fluidsynth fluid-soundfont-gm`;
  MIT licence). Without them `mix.py` falls back to the older synthesised score.
- For the capture only: PostgreSQL 16 reachable through `TEST_PG_ADMIN_URL`, as for the end-to-end tests.

## 1. Capture the product

```sh
TEST_PG_ADMIN_URL=postgres://… npm run capture
```

Runs `capture/showcase.spec.ts` against the end-to-end server (port 3100) with the same database setup as
`npm run test:e2e`, in Arabic, on a 1440 × 810 window at device scale 2.5 (phones 390 × 844 at 3). It walks
through the demo school's whole story (sign-up to platform console) and writes
`../recordings/<shot>/NNN.jpg` and `../recordings/shots.json` (54 recordings, 538 frames). One-time passwords,
the two-step QR code and key, and local addresses are blurred as they are captured. The background worker is
started part-way, so `ALERT_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS` is raised to keep its first health check from being reported.
The run needs `127.0.0.1 lessons.nilevalley.example` in `/etc/hosts` for the invented webhook host, and
permission to listen on port 80 there (the receiver that stands in for the school's lesson platform).

## 2. Documents and subtitles

```sh
npm run docs          # STORYBOARD, narration, translation, scene sheet, coverage matrix
node build.mjs prepare 20 && node build.mjs prepare 3     # also writes the SRT files
```

## 3. Narration

The narration is recorded by an Egyptian narrator in formal MSA. `node narrator-pack.mjs` writes the recording
pack (`../Narrator_Recording_Pack.pdf`, `../NARRATOR_RECORDING_PACK.md`): reading style, recording
specification, file names and delivery, English terms, and every line with its full tashkeel, approximate length,
the hamzat al-wasl joins that are easy to misread and the reading notes of `script/narrator-notes.mjs` (from the
independent tashkeel review of 2026-10-28).

The recordings go to `../audio/recorded/<cut>/`, one file per line (`<sceneId>-NN.wav`) or one per scene
(`<sceneId>.wav`, lines in order with about two seconds between them). Then:

```sh
node ingest.mjs all          # → ../audio/narration/<cut>/…, report in ../build/ingest/report.json
python3 lib/asr_check.py ../build/ingest/asr-lines.json <whisper-dir> ../build/ingest/asr.json
node build.mjs all 20 2160 && node build.mjs all 20 1080 && node build.mjs all 3 1080
```

`ingest.mjs` splits scene files at their pauses, cleans every take as a broadcast editor would (rumble filter,
noise reduction only in a noisy room, de-essing, gentle compression), keeps the breath before and the natural
decay after each line with short fades, and writes 48 kHz 24-bit takes where the timeline reads them. Its report
flags clipping, a noisy room, a quiet recording and a pace far from the other lines; the speech-recognition check
catches a misread or misplaced line. Tested on stand-in recordings of the 3-minute cut (scene files and line
files, with room noise): all 28 lines split and prepared, recognition error unchanged (5.0 %).

The timeline uses each take's real length; scenes, pointer, camera, music cues and subtitles follow. After a
line that ends a sentence it leaves 0.8 s of silence, after a colon or comma 0.45 s. Lines without a take keep
the estimate, and `prepare` reports how many are recorded.

Until the recordings arrive, the films can be built with a synthetic guide voice. The guide takes (2026-10-28)
use the open-source Piper voice
`ar_JO-kareem-medium` (sherpa-onnx GitHub release `tts-models`), **with our own pronunciation**: the voice is not
given the text. `audio/arabic_g2p.py` turns each diacritized line into phonemes by the reading rules, and the
phoneme ids go straight to the model, so nothing re-reads or guesses the vowels:

```sh
python3 -m venv /path/to/venv && /path/to/venv/bin/pip install piper-tts
S='--length-scale 0.76 --noise-scale 0.333 --noise-w 0.4 --sentence-silence 0.3'
PIPER_PYTHON=/path/to/venv/bin/python node narrate.mjs 20 --voice ar_JO-kareem-medium.onnx $S
PIPER_PYTHON=/path/to/venv/bin/python node narrate.mjs 3 --voice ar_JO-kareem-medium.onnx $S
python3 -m unittest discover -s audio -p 'test_*.py'     # the reading rules
```

Why: Piper (like most open voices) reads Arabic through espeak-ng, which mispronounces fully diacritized text.
Checked word by word over both scripts, it drops the vowel after every shadda when the marks are in Unicode's
normal order (الشَّمْسُ → ʔaʃʃmsu, سَنُدَرِّسُ → sanudarrsu), reads a waw or ya that carries a vowel as a vowel
(هِيَ → hiːa, بَيَانَات → baiaːnaːt), ignores hamzat al-wasl (بِالْمَنْهَجِ → bi aːlmanhadʒi), reads ذَلِكَ and
هَذَا with a short a, and has no pausal forms. The rules in `arabic_g2p.py`: every short vowel, tanween, sukun and
shadda as written; long vowels and diphthongs; the dagger alif also where it is not written (هٰذَا، ذٰلِكَ،
لٰكِنَّ، هٰكَذَا); hamzat al-wasl (silent in connected speech, a long vowel before it shortened, a helping vowel after
a consonant, ʔa / ʔi after a pause); the article's lam assimilated to sun letters; iqlab (n → m before b); pausal
forms before every pause; ta marbuta; stress. Phonemes are written in espeak's own notation, the one the voice
was trained on. The phonemes of every line are saved next to the line list (`build/<cut>/narration-lines-phonemes.json`).

`--length-scale` sets the pace, `--sentence-silence` the pause between sentences, `--max-pause` (0.28 s) shortens
the pauses the voice makes at commas, `--noise-scale` and `--noise-w` its variation; `--tempo` time-stretches (not
used). The settings above were chosen by the speech-recognition check on the 24 hardest lines: 0.76 with the lower
variation gave a 7.8 % character error rate, against 11.4 % at 0.72 with the voice's default variation (0.8 was
clearer still, 6.6 %, but would make the 20-minute cut almost 22 minutes). The 20-minute cut is 20.7 minutes, the
3-minute cut 3.1. Lines that
already have a file are skipped, so a human take placed first is kept; `--force` regenerates, `--only <sceneId>`
limits to one scene.

**The voice's licence could not be confirmed**: its model card refers to a training-data repository that states
no licence. Other Arabic voices were checked: the three newer Piper voices (`ar_JO-SA_dii`, `SA_miro`,
`SA_miro_V2`) are CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (no commercial use), and Nabra-82M (Kokoro architecture, licence also not
confirmable here) was far less intelligible in the speech-recognition check (15–17 % character error rate
against 3.7 %), cut line endings and cannot tell س from ص.

`--engine azure` uses an Azure AI Speech neural voice instead (default `ar-SA-ZariyahNeural`, `--rate` for the
pace; `node narrate.mjs samples` renders two lines per voice). It needs `AZURE_SPEECH_KEY` and
`AZURE_SPEECH_REGION` as environment secrets (never in the repository or the chat) and
`*.tts.speech.microsoft.com` allowed by the network policy. The requests go through curl; the key is passed to
curl on its standard input, never on the command line or on disk.

`lib/asr_check.py` transcribes the takes with Whisper (small, sherpa-onnx `asr-models` release) and reports a
character error rate per line against the script (each take padded with half a second of silence, as in the
film; without it Whisper tends to drop the last word), to find lines worth listening to.

## 4. Build a cut

```sh
node build.mjs all 20 2160    # → Education_SaaS_Product_Showcase_20min.mp4 (3840 × 2160)
node build.mjs all 20 1080    # → Education_SaaS_Product_Showcase_1080p.mp4
node build.mjs all 3 1080     # → Education_SaaS_Product_Showcase_3min.mp4
node build.mjs all 3 2160     # → Education_SaaS_Product_Showcase_3min_4K.mp4
```

Add `--captions` while there is no narration: the narration is burned in as Arabic captions with a
"PREVIEW — NO NARRATION" tag, and the files are named `…_PREVIEW_no-narration.mp4`. `--workers n` sets the
number of parallel browsers (default 4). On 4 cores, 1080p renders at about 22 frames per second (the
20-minute cut in about 27 minutes); 2160p takes roughly three times as long.

Loudness is normalised in two passes to −16 LUFS with narration (−18 without), aiming at −2 dBTP so the AAC
file stays under −1.5 dBTP.

The score (`audio/score.py`) is composed for the cut and played on recorded instruments with FluidSynth and the
FluidR3 soundfont: piano, strings, cello, harp, celesta, a warm pad, bass and soft percussion, in D major at
84 BPM, four related chord progressions, the instrumentation set by each scene's music cue and changing over
three seconds, the last chords resolving home. The music bus is filtered (no rumble, a small dip where speech is
most intelligible), gently compressed, and set to the loudness the mix was balanced for; under the narration it is
ducked by 10 dB. To use a licensed track instead, put it at `../music/<cut>-override.wav`.
